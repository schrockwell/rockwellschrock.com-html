<h2>Rubber-Duck-Driven Development</h2>
<h3>April 17, 2023</h3>

<p>Today, I sat down to some code I wrote a week ago. I came across the assignment:</p>

<pre>
loading?: true
</pre>

<p>
  "Huh," I thought. "This is confusing. This isn't really an indication that anything is actually loading. In fact, we
  show a <i>fake</i> loading state for 500 milliseconds, while we sleep and wait for the text input to
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/bindings.html#rate-limiting-events-with-debounce-and-throttle"
    >debounce</a
  >
  before actually loading anything. This variable just controls if the indeterminate spinner is visible. I should
  document that."
</p>

<pre>
+ # Controls if the spinner is visible
  loading?: true
</pre>

<p>"Wait a second..."</p>

<pre>
- # Controls if the spinner is visible
- loading?: true
+ spinner_visible?: true
</pre>

<p>
  And magically, through the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>,
  it was made better.
</p>

<p>
  As always,
