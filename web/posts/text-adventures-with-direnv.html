  If you use <a href="https://direnv.net">direnv</a> to configure your local development environment, you might run into
  a situation where one set of environment variables does not cut it.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a front-end JS application might need to connect to number of different server environments, such as
  local development, staging, or production.
</p>
<p>Here's a little secret: <b>.envrc is just a shell script</b>. There's nothing magic about it.</p>
<p>
  Armed with that knowledge, here's an iteration of <code>.envrc</code> that prompts the user for the environment when
  switching into the project directory:
</p>

<pre>
# .envrc
export COMMON_ENV=here

echo -n "Configure [d]evelopment, [s]taging, or [p]roduction? "
read

case $REPLY in 
  p)
    echo 'Configuring production environment'
    export BASE_URL=https://example.com
    ;;
  s)
    echo 'Configuring staging environment'
    export BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com
    ;;
  *)
    echo 'Configuring development environment'
    export BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
    ;;
esac
</pre>

<p>Now, when you <code>cd</code> into the project directory:</p>

<pre>
❯ cd myapp
direnv: loading ~/myapp/.envrc
Configure [d]evelopment, [s]taging, or [p]roduction? d
Configuring development environment
direnv: export +COMMON_ENV +BASE_URL
</pre>

<p>
  Just don't enter the wrong input, or you might be
