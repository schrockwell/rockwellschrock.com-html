<h2>One Year of Morsle</h2>
<h3>April 2, 2023</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://morsle.fun/">Morsle</a> has been out for a year, so I thought it would be fun to peruse some stats.
</p>

<p>Or, you can <a href="https://plausible.io/morsle.fun">look at the stats yourself</a>.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>91,120 unique visitors</b>, or an average of 250 every day. That's 91,119 more people than Samuel Morse.</li>
  <li><b>114,411 total visits</b>. I guess 23,291 people didn't get the memo that this is a <i>daily</i> challenge.</li>
  <li><b>372,097 total pageviews</b> by the folks who <i>really</i> wanted to visit that Settings screen.</li>
  <li><b>27% bounce rate</b> which I choose to attribute entirely to bots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daily challenge</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>56% of visitors completed the daily challenge</b>, which coincidentally equals my KDR in Halo Infinite.</li>
  <li><b>99.2% win rate</b> which indicates that maybe I did make the game too easy.</li>
  <li><b>17% of players chose hard mode</b> which, as established, was not clearly hard enough.</li>
  <li><b>46% of players won at 40 WPM</b>, suggesting that perhaps the game's easiness quotient was too large.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practice mode</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>22.6% of visitors played practice mode</b> to get better at

      >cheating on exams</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>36% of practice mode games were for callsigns</b>, by people who should have been using a real tool like
    <a href="https://lcwo.net/">Learn CW Online</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>19% of practice mode games were in hard mode</b> by Chad operators who have never touched a microphone in their
    lives.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous thoughts</h3>

<p>
  I have received a very small number of support emails. Also, this project was my first time dipping my toe into
  browser-based testing with <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>. Coincidence?
</p>

<p>
  Boy, it is nice having a <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">fully-static site</a> hosted for free on
  <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">a manged provider</a>, with no server component to mange or upkeep. You can't beat
  that peace of mind. I should do more fun little projects like this.
</p>

<p>
  This completely failed as a viral marketing campaign for
  <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/">Remote Ham Radio</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I think originally I put 500 words in there? It's probably time to revisit that and add some more for the upcoming
  year. And I need to find a better word list &ndash; I received a lot of complaints about that.

<p>Dit dit!</p>
